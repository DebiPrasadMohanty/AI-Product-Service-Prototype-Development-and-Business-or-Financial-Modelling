Pneumonia Disease Detection Tool: AI-Driven Diagnostic Solution for Healthcare
- This repository contains all essential files for the Pneumonia Disease Detection Tool project, including reports, datasets, and code implementations for the development and business/financial modeling of the prototype.

Project Overview
- The Pneumonia Disease Detection Tool is an AI-powered diagnostic platform that assists healthcare providers by accurately identifying pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Utilizing deep learning and explainable AI, the tool offers real-time diagnostic support, benefiting both large hospitals and resource-limited rural clinics.

Key functionalities include:

- Automated Pneumonia Detection: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze X-ray images.
- Real-Time Diagnostics: Provides instant feedback to healthcare providers.
- Explainable AI (XAI): Integrated Grad-CAM and LIME explanations offer interpretability for model predictions.
- Scalable and Mobile-Friendly: TensorFlow Lite deployment for mobile diagnostics in remote areas.
Files in the Repository
- Report.pdf: A comprehensive report detailing the Pneumonia Disease Detection Tool, including its core functionalities, business model, technical architecture, and financial modeling approach.

- app.py: A Streamlit app script that provides a user interface for uploading chest X-ray images, receiving real-time pneumonia diagnosis, and displaying Grad-CAM and LIME explanations.

Results and Insights
- Pneumonia Detection: Classifies chest X-rays as "pneumonia" or "normal" with a high degree of accuracy, leveraging a CNN-based model fine-tuned on labeled X-ray images.

Explainable AI Explanations:

- Grad-CAM: Visual heatmaps highlight key areas of the X-ray that the model focuses on for its prediction.
- LIME: Provides interpretable explanations by generating feature importance maps for each prediction.
Mobile Deployment: Deploys the model using TensorFlow Lite for efficient on-device diagnostics, suitable for healthcare professionals in remote areas.
